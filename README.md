# Getting Started with Create React App

This is the frontend part of the assignment. Simple run the backend first and npm start and the front end will start.
There should be more test to be added but since I don't have enough time simple and snapshot tests are included.
The UI is designed responsively on website and mobile should also work too.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It will run the jest test.
